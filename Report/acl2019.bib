@article{nedic,
title = "Distributed asynchronous incremental subgradient methods",
abstract = "We propose and analyze a distributed asynchronous subgradient method for minimizing a convex function that consists of the sum of a large number of component functions. This type of minimization arises in a dual context from Lagrangian relaxation of the coupling constraints of large scale separable problems. The idea is to distribute the computation of the component subgradients among a set of processors, which communicate only with a coordinator. The coordinator performs the subgradient iteration incrementally and asynchronously, by taking steps along the subgradients of the component funtions that are available at the update time. The incremental approach has performed very well in centralized computation, and the parallel implementation should improve its performance substantially, particularly for typical problems where computation of the component subgradients is relatively costly.",

booktitle = {IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing},

month = {January},
abstract = {We propose a novel context-dependent (CD) model for large vocabulary speech recognition (LVSR) that leverages recent advances in using deep belief networks for phone recognition. We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively.},
